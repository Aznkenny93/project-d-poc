# Project D: Emerging Technologies Proof of Concept 

This is the Code Repository for Project D at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.

In the CMI-wide project Emerging Media/Emerging Technologies, the technical creativity and research methods of students are matched with companies that are interested in research and development with the new technology. You will be working in a team on a case of the Product Owner that can be solved with a new technology. It is important that you show a professional attitude towards your Product Owner, both written and verbally. Your teachers will monitor your progress and in addition to that, the Product Owner will visit you during project hours to discuss your progress and results.

## Concept Description

Imagine never having to use a key or NFC card to enter a room in a hotel. That's what this proof of concept is all about. The 'Keyless Door Entry System' uses facial recognition to enable entry to rooms in the hospitality branch. The proof of concept includes resevering rooms, a lobby registration demo and door entry demo.

# Installation and setup

## Backend installation and setup

This backend is built using Python. It includes facial recognition modules and more. The backend is a fully functional server application built using Django. 

1. First make sure you have a compatible version of Python installed. Which version? Django is used as framework, therefore we are dependent on the Python version they are using. According to Django documentation: Python 3 is recommended. Django 1.11 is the last version to support Python 2.7. Support for Python 2.7 and Django 1.11 ends in 2020.

2. Install Django. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/install/)

3. Install other dependencies for the project. These can be found in requirements.txt in the root folder of this project.
